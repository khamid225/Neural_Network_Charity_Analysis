# Neural Network Model

### Overview 

The objective of this work is to analyse past funding results by Alphabet Soup to determine which organizations should be funded and also use deep learning neural network to interpret large complex datasets. We use Machine learning and Neural networks on Tensor Flow Keras to create a binary classifier that can predict the success of being funded by Alphabet Soup.

### Results

* *Data Preprocessing*
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?



  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your
model?
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should
be removed from the input data?

* *Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model*
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you
select for your neural network model, and why?
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model
performance?

### Summary

(Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model.
Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this
classification problem, and explain your recommendation.)
